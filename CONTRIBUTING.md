# Contribution Guidelines

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :+1:

## I just have a question

You can launch a quick question on the [#antwerp-ui slack channel](https://digantcafe.slack.com/messages/CDDLYJU65/). If you're not yet a member of the DigAnt Café slack community, you can easily [join here](https://digantcafe-slack.digipolis.be).

For something that requires longer discussion it may be better to book an issue.

## How do I report bugs / ask features?

Please book a GitHub issue.

## What should I know to get started?

This widget is part of the [Antwerp UI platform](https://antwerp-ui.digipolis.be). For more info about Smart Widgets, check the [documentation hub](https://github.com/digipolisantwerp/smart-widgets).

Before contributing code, you should be aware of the following:

- The look and feel should match the [Antwerp Core Branding guidelines](https://github.com/a-ui/core_branding_scss).
- The architecture consists of a separate front-end and back-end package. The back-end is a so-called Backend-For-Frontend (BFF). The architecture should conform to the [SA2020 guidelines](https://goo.gl/izTzSH).
- There may be multiple independent front-ends and back-ends for the different technologies that Digipolis supports. All of these should implement the same BFF API. The set of supported technologies is described in the [DAAS standard](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vR9N3gAJoJFIlaXnpAfSpog85EN1DXJYy5bWHgZ4XKhy8KN1v6xgT4-eaoTTBTEzhIpMGqd_Q11RuKF/pubhtml).
- All code should conform to the [Angular style guide](https://angular.io/guide/styleguide), as well as the [Antwerp UI guidelines](https://antwerp-ui.digipolis.be/docs/guidelines).
